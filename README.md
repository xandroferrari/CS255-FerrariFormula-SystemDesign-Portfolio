# 🏎️ CS255-FerrariFormula-SystemDesign-Portfolio

Welcome to my system design portfolio for CS255, featuring the DriverPass project. This repository showcases my ability to translate business requirements into a fully modeled system architecture using industry-standard tools and techniques.

## 📦 Contents

This portfolio includes two key deliverables:

### 🔹 Project One: Business Requirements
- **Document:** `DriverPass_Business_Requirements.pdf`
- **Focus:** Captures client goals, user needs, and functional expectations for the DriverPass system.

### 🔹 Project Two: System Design
- **Document:** `DriverPass_System_Design.pdf`
- **UML Diagrams:**
  - Use Case Diagram
  - Activity Diagrams
  - Sequence Diagram
  - Class Diagram
- **Focus:** Models system behavior, data structures, and lifecycle integration using Lucidchart, MySQL, React, Node.js, and AWS.

## 🧠 Reflection Journal

The DriverPass project was designed for a fictional client offering driver education services. They needed a system to streamline lesson scheduling, instructor management, and student progress tracking.

What I did particularly well was blending technical rigor with visual storytelling. My UML diagrams are color-coded, audience-friendly, and aligned with real-world workflows. I also crafted a lifecycle overview that bridges design with deployment.

If I were to revise one part, I’d enhance the lifecycle diagram with swimlanes to clarify stakeholder responsibilities across phases.

Interpreting user needs was central to my approach. I translated client goals into use cases, modeled workflows, and built a class structure that reflects real-world data. Designing with users in mind ensures the system is intuitive, efficient, and impactful.

My design strategy combines analytical precision with creative problem-solving. I use UML modeling, stakeholder analysis, and iterative refinement to build systems that are both functional and elegant. In future projects, I’ll incorporate more prototyping and user testing to validate early design decisions.
